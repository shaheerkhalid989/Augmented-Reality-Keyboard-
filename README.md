# Augmented Reality Keyboard

## Overview
The **Augmented Reality Floating Keyboard** is a virtual keyboard built using **Python** and **computer vision** technologies. This project enables users to type using a floating, touchless keyboard that appears in AR space, detected via hand gestures. It is ideal for **virtual environments, accessibility solutions, and futuristic user interfaces**.

## Features
- âœ… **Hand Tracking & Gesture Recognition** â€“ Utilizes **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to detect fingers and recognize keystrokes.
- âœ… **Floating Virtual Keyboard** â€“ A dynamic keyboard overlay that appears in AR space.
- âœ… **Real-Time Interaction** â€“ Detects finger taps and converts them into keystrokes for real-time typing.
- âœ… **Customizable Layout** â€“ Supports different keyboard layouts, sizes, and styles.
- âœ… **Python & OpenCV Based** â€“ Developed using **Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe**, ensuring efficiency and ease of use.
- âœ… **No Additional Hardware Required** â€“ Works with just a **webcam or built-in camera**.

## How It Works
1. **Camera Input** â€“ The webcam captures real-time hand movements.
2. **Hand Detection** â€“ The system detects fingers and their positions using **MediaPipe Hands**.
3. **Key Press Detection** â€“ When a finger "presses" a virtual key, it registers the input.
4. **Text Output** â€“ The recognized key is displayed on the screen as typed text.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ar-floating-keyboard.git
cd ar-floating-keyboard
```

## Usage
Run the script to launch the AR keyboard:
```bash
python ar_keyboard.py
```

## Potential Use Cases
- ðŸ”¹ **Virtual Reality (VR) & AR Applications**
